### Exploratory analysis of mRNA expression data

*7 December 2017*

Import files

```{r}
exdata <- read.delim("AIBL_Gene_Expression.txt", sep = " ", header = T)
metadata <- read.delim("aibl-ids-6.0.0-201712010300.txt", sep = "\t", header = T)
ids <- read.delim("AIBL_Gene_Expression_IDs.txt", header = F)
```




#### Meeting with JD 20171213

*Use the `limma` package to make volcano plots, for both "PET status" (yes or no) and APOE4 (yes or no)

*Do all possible pairwise combinations of the above two, i.e. PET yes & APOE no, APOE yes & PET no, etc.

*Screen out those that are interesting.Once we have a "top table"", pull out the top genes and go into KEGG, or write a function that finds all the other genes in the pathway for each of the genes.

*Then go back and find the values for those genes - is there a reltaionship or not.
